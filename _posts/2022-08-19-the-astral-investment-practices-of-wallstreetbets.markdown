For many people, the stock market represents a way towards building a future outside the confines of their day jobs. A lucrative endeavor in which their assets are employed. Their money working for them, and not the other way around, if you will.
Just invest a couple of thousand every month, and with some research and due diligence, watch it compound and grow.

In one corner, you've got the professional investors - the bankers and finance guys trading on behalf of large institutions, managing millions or billions. Equipped with their fully stocked trading desks, walls of monitors, direct access terminals and armed with years of experience and every trick in the book.

In the other corner, you've got the retail investor: your above average financially literate person seeking to transform the financial aspect of their lives, one step at a time, and build wealth alongside their 9-5 jobs. More or less, they keep their time-tested low-risk investment strategies always in sight and rarely invest into something other than their favourite large market caps or most reputable indices.

Unfortunately, some are not interested in waiting years to observe growth.
Some want their money today and are not afraid to take unprecedented risk.

This is the story of WallstreetBets.

# Overview 

By turning stocks and hedging strategies from boring financial drivel for nerds into flashy graphs and memes, the modern investors from the subreddit page called WallstreetBets have managed to convert the entire investment world into their personal casino. Combine that with fresh zero fee trading apps that fit into everyone's pocket as well as locking everyone up in their house for months, and you've got a critical mass of getting rich of dying trying.

The process is simple:

The WallstreetBets subreddit dweller starts their investment career by downloading Robinhood, a free zero commission stock brokerage app, infamous for being low in quality and high in bugs and glitches. Sure, Robinhood being lowest caliber brokerage app surely does attract the same kind of investors, but look on the positive side: it just about works.

Once they're in, the next step is to read up terms and conditions as well as anything at all regarding best investment practices. But this step is completely optional.

They are now set.
Time to lose money.

# THE MOS EISLEY OF FINANCE 

Bull posts, bear posts, gains, losses, but mostly shitposts and memes, and an occasional actually useful stock tip buried under the aforementioned. This is WallstreetBets
Don't forget, of course, WSB's essential investment strategy: the YOLO. 

YOLO-ing in, you guessed it, consists of glancing at a few graphs, skim reading a few articles, pretending to have fully grasped the topic and dumping all the cash available in your account into a certain stock or option, with the real selection of choice often being buying options on SPY: a fund that corresponds to the overall US stock market.

A crash course on stock options, if I may:

Stock options are rights to buy or sell a stock at a specified price, called the strike price, at a specified date, called the expiration date. When you're buying a call option, you're paying a premium fee upfront, hoping that the value of the corresponding stock will be higher in the future, as to profit off of the difference. The further the actual price surpasses your strike price, the more your call option is worth. You may then sell your options at any time to someone else, for a value that often corresponds to the difference of those two prices.

However, if the actual price of that stock ends up lower than the strike price, you'll be going on a little unplanned diet this month.

Put options are the opposite thing, you're buying a right to sell, thus betting that the price is going to go lower.

If an option is worth anything, you may exercise the right warranted by this option, or sell the option outright for cash.

But, why even deal with options, when there are perfectly good stocks out there.

It's simple. Trading options allows for much greater profits, sometimes up to 10 times the investment, akin to leverage trading. The downside, of course, is that your stock options can go to zero, thus you could end up losing the entirety of your investment. 

With only the short introduction to WSB I've given you so far, I'm confident you can already see where this is going.


# WHERE IT ALL STARTED 

You wake up. It's 2012, and you're a reddit user by name of Jartek. You love telling others of your high-risk esoteric trading ideas, and as such you are banned from r/Investing. You say "screw them", and set out to open your own subreddit page.
And so, an innocent-looking new subreddit is born, called WallstreetBets.

What could possibly go wrong?

As the subreddit started out, the people who mostly set their sights upon it were various penny-stock and options trading fans who also just happen to browse other lesser known Internet chat boards, like 4chan/biz. For some time, the daily talk was confined to sensible and mentally consistent investment strategies devised by some with half a brain. But it woudn't last for long. More specifically, it would last until the time Robinhood launched.

By 2016, the subreddit is 50 000 members strong, and the content starts spilling into r/all, which helps exacerbate the influx of degen posting to an entire new level.

Numerous events unfold over the next few years. Some users report having made eight figures, starting from fourty-three thousand.

Someone else make a hundred thousand completely by accident.

Martin Shkreli becomes a mod.

And the subreddit reaches 700 000 members by 2019.

# u/1ronyman 

Let me tell you a story of a certain subreddit poster by the name of 1ronyman.

Unsatisfied with the subreddit's boring investment strategies that were far too simplistic and ordinary for their taste, 1ronyman finally sets out to employ a bolder, more insane technique. 

This was no ordinary options trade. 

This was a box spread. A highly sophisticated maneuver that involves both buying and selling an equal number of options simultaneously, at the same strike price and expiry date. The intention was to leverage pricing inefficiencies introduced by the house.

Of course, such a thing would be unprofitable when counting in the cost of transaction, but here's the catch:

Robinhood offered trading free of commission charge.

Surely, you would expect the exploitation of every nook and cranny from a WSB member. But there is more.

With enough time and repetition, 1ronyman manages to take his initial five thousand dollar capital into a much larger position of three hundred thousand.

![no-alignment]({{ 'images/post3/image3.png' | absolute_url }})

Now, obviously, this should not even be possible, but 1ronyman's strategy was autistic enough not even Robinhood's risk management knew how it could be done.

According to 1ronyman, the technique was completely safe, and no money could be lost. If the options remained unexercised, in two years he'd make about fourty thousand dollars.

Being the bragging grounds of a hyper-successful zoomer trader, he goes on WSB and shows everyone the strategy. Immediately recognizing that there was in fact risk, other members warn him not to continue trading that, but 1ronyman knew better. 

Telling everyone that up theirs, our hero continues the project, but misses one fatal flaw. 

The flaw being that the idea was retarded enough that now, knowing about it, many other young WSB'ers would start copying it.

1ronyman thought that for every call he sold being exercised he could exercise a call he purchased meaning a loss of only 500 per spread.

But here's the thing.

He sold 500 spreads. On the same day, the buyers began exercising them. So many, in fact, that 1ronyman was forced to close almost 300 spreads in a single day.

He gets margin called for a boatload of money he doesn't even have.

Such a high negative position, naturally, alerts Robinhood to the situation, and 1ronyman gets deleted from the platform. Box spreads were patched against from the platform and the day is called.

But things weren't as bleak for 1ronyman as it initially appeared. Turns out 1ronyman managed to withdraw ten thousand dollars from Robinhood, all while losing Robinhood at least sixty thousand dollars. The bastard actually ended up doubling his money.

# Analfarmer2 

Another story, this time of a college student with high aspirations of holding his own stake in the world, via trading stocks.

First seen on Wallstreetbets circa 2018, this promising investment amateur quickly rises within the ranks of United States Dollar holders, supposedly gained by putting their trading skills in practice. A particularly interesting story of theirs is their venture with Align Technologies.

Analfarmer2 leverages their hundred thousand dollars capital and goes all in on short-term expiry calls on a company called Align Technologies, a company reputed for manufacture of 3D digital scanners and the Invisalign clear aligners used in orthodontics, from Arizona.

The trade is successful, and the guy triples his money.

He then bets that, since the market had gone up today, it would fall tomorrow, naturally. He then apes in and buys 170k worth of Zero Day Expiry Puts (0DE Puts). These products are contracts that expire the next day, so they're high risk high reward by design.

It was as if Analfarmer2 could read the future. A quick tweet from Donald Trump announcing a new Chinese tariffs package instills some short-term fear within the market, and the value of Analfarmer2's Put contracts goes through the roof. The guy takes home another 300k in profits.

Proud of his accomplishments and more confident in his skills than ever, Analfarmer2 then buys 600k worth of 0DE Calls. Calls, of course, being betting that the market was going to go up. He goes to sleep.

The next day, the market opens, and its all blood everywhere. Everything is red, and the guy is in panic. Most of the value in those Calls is deleted, and he sells what remaining value they held for 100k, leaving his capital at only about 200k.

Mistakes happen, he thinks to himself, and thinking that it was okay, he makes plans to make that 500k back with a few good and calculated trades.

A week goes by and he is down another 160k. 

Alright, he says. Time to trade this one like a man. Fortune favors the bold, after all.

He realizes that there's an earnings report inbound for a company called Canopy Growth Corp, in a few days. He YOLOs in the entirety of his remaining funds.

Earnings report comes in, and its a horror story.  It's a total crash, and Analfarmer2's position is in negative. 

At this point, his written contributions sort of ceased, but it is believed that he lost the rest of his funds that week.

Can you imagine having traded to peaks of almost a million dollars, during your years as a college student, of all things, and then managing to blow it all up and becoming less successful in dollar terms than never having done a single thing outside of buying large, slow-moving indices or ETFs?

WSB hasn't heard from Analfarmer2 ever since. I really hope he is doing alright.

### ControlTheNarrative ###

Some time after the wrap-up of Analfarmer2's story, some guy called ControlTheNarrative discovers a thing.

Initially, he dealt with leverage trading Microsoft around the time of the company's earnings report. He loses a few tens of thousands and declares that he is quitting stock trading.

That didn't last long.

Three days later, he's back, and this time around he only has two thousand dollars. But here's a thing. Turns out there is a bug on Robinhood that allows you to get infinite leverage. The issue was exploited by making use of Robinhood Gold, a monthly subscription service, that allows for two-to-one leverage.

ControlTheNarrative buy a few thousand dollars of AMD shares, half of that being leveraged. He then sells his AMD stocks as Call options and receives a premium dollar amount equal to his initial AMD investment. But this time, the platform considers this money equity, free of leverage. It was essentially laundering money of its leverage status.

He repeats the process and now has seven and a half thousand.

He keeps repeating the process up to some fifty thousand dollars. 

He then YOLOs in all that money to buy Apple puts several days prior to an earnings report, expecting bad reports.

That was the catch. That was also where ol' Tim Cook got him, for on his desktop he had a document displaying great quarterly financial results, coincidentally named "earnings report.pdf".

ControlTheNarrative is down 25 times his entire account's worth in a second.

Bless his soul.

The exploit was quickly fixed, and Robinhood PR team was dispatched to WSB itself to clarify the company's policies against such malpractice. They were quickly banned from the subreddit.

# The greatest UNO Reverse card of modern times 

Its February 2020, and the economy is seemingly doing better than ever. WSB is at almost a million members. It was all perfect, the world was in economic heaven, except for some weird things happening in China, barely worth a mention.

What's that? There's a city locked down in China? Something about a novel respiratory virus? Surely nothing we haven't seen so far.

Fast forward a month and the entire world has it. Governments are locking down left and right. 

Even a broken clock is correct twice a day. Bobo the bear was about to claim ultimate victory after a decade of being beaten mercilessly by angry bulls. His puts were going to print very nicely. And they so printed. But only for a month.

Things were getting out of hand. The economy was closed shut all around the world. Supplies were running out, unemployment was through the roof, rent wasn't being paid. We were on the brink of some sort of financial apocalypse.

As Bobo the bear was rubbing his hand in expectation of huge profits, he wasn't aware of his mortal enemy concocting a master plan, behind the scenes: Jerome Powell.

The Federal Bank's right hand man, Jerome Powell, had a few tricks up his sleeve. Turns out, The FED was just so cleaning out old wardrobes and found a relic from a time ago. Turns out, the FED had a uncovered an old real-life, infinite money glitch.

They had a money printer. And it printed money.

The recssion was cancelled instantly.

![no-alignment]({{ 'images/post3/image7.jpeg' | absolute_url }})

Out of thin air, The FED created 2.5 trillion dollars to help fight against the kung-flu, in February alone. Then another six to ten trillion through the end of the year, including unlimited repurchasing of government bonds, stimulus packages to whoever wanted them, and highly probable undisclosed infinite money drop-packages to corporations to prevent layoffs.

Imagine the scenery. 40 million unemployed - yet the markets are up.

The economy monkey-wrenched - stocks and indices are as green as Bliss, the Windows XP Default background photo.

With one snap of his fingers, Jerome Powell had ended the crash instantly.

Hundreds of thousands dying worldwide - S&P all-time high.

Bears were utterly destroyed (you'd be wrong if you thought this'd change their minds, though).

![no-alignment]({{ 'images/post3/image8.png' | absolute_url }})

It had been a crazy few months, but over the summer, it looked like everything was returning back to normal. The virus was quelled, at least for now. For a short while, it seemed we were in tranquil waters. 

That was, at least, the outlook from a 2020 standpoint. You, of course, know that 2021 proved to be a vastly crazier reiteration of the events from 2020. But that is a story for another time.

Whether or not 2022 through 2025 will serve to undo much of the fake economic growth introduced by this brutal printing campaign, only time will tell.
